# Documentation Release
MMRF docs release numbers parallel those used for the MMRF tools.  You can find old documentation releases on the [docs GitHub home page](https://github.com/uc-cdis/docs-gen3).  You can find information about the relevant MMRF software releases in the [cdis-manifest repo](https://github.com/uc-cdis/cdis-manifest/tree/master/releases).

# How to request updates
Create an issue within this repo to report on issues or gaps in the documentation.  If it is a large change you would like to see, it is better to start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/uc-cdis/docs-gen3/issues/new/choose).

If it is something small and you are comfortable using GitHub please just create a pull request and we can review that.

# Create your own changes and submit them

If you know what changes are needed we encourage you to create a PR.  [Follow these steps to make changes and verify them with MkDocs](./to-update-docs-gen3.md).

# Community Engagement

We encourage MMRF community users to join the Gen3 Community Slack channel to get assistance from and provide support to other community members and be alerted to Gen3 releases, webinars, and other developments. The Gen3 development team is also available on this Slack workspace for fielding technical questions. Please join with an organizational email, or be prepared to confirm your institutional affiliation by email. (If you have no institutional affiliation, you may still join, but we may have more questions for you.)
