# What is the MMRF Virtual Lab?

The MMRF Virtual Lab is a secure, cloud-based data platform designed to accelerate multiple myeloma research through open, collaborative science. Built on the Gen3 framework, the Virtual Lab enables researchers to explore, analyze, and share genomic and clinical data from the MMRF research programs, including CoMMpass, Immune Atlas, and other initiatives. 

Virtual Lab brings together comprehensive multi-omics datasets and advanced visualization tools in one environment, helping researchers generate insights, develop hypotheses, and drive discoveries that improve outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma.


## Powered by Gen3

The MMRF Virtual Lab is powered by the Gen3 open-source data platform, developed by the Center for Translational Data Science (CTDS) at the University of Chicago. Gen3 provides the flexible and scalable infrastructure that supports the MMRF's mission to make data accessible, interoperable, and reusable. 

You can find more information about Gen3 on [gen3.org](https://gen3.org/).
