# About the MMRF CoMMpass Study

The **MMRF CoMMpass Study** is a landmark, multi-year effort designed to characterize newly diagnosed multiple myeloma through integrated genomic and clinical profiling. It is one of the most comprehensive longitudinal datasets ever generated in myeloma and has played a central role in advancing our understanding of disease biology, risk, and therapeutic response.

More than **1,100 patients** were enrolled at diagnosis and prospectively followed for up to **8 years**, with structured clinical assessments and repeated sequencing of bone marrow and blood. The study was intentionally designed to reflect *real-world medical practice*, enabling insights that translate directly to patient care.

<!-- ## Study Structure

The final CoMMpass dataset includes **1,143 total subjects**, drawn from two complementary subcohorts:

### **Subcohort One - Observational Study (n = 971)**
- Patients were followed prospectively from diagnosis.  
- Clinical data, biospecimen collection, and genomic profiling occurred at predefined intervals.  
- Serial sequencing provided insights into clonal evolution and therapy response.  

### **Subcohort Two - FORTE Trial Subset (n = 172)**
- Patients were enrolled in a clinical trial with eligibility criteria comparable to the observational cohort.  
- Contributed baseline and follow-up clinical data plus matched biospecimens for genomic analysis.  
- Follow-up duration up to **5 years**.

Together, these cohorts form a harmonized resource spanning broad demographic, clinical, and treatment landscapes.

## Data Collected

Across both subcohorts, CoMMpass captured:

- **Demographic data** (e.g., age, race, sex)
- **Disease characteristics** at diagnosis
- **Laboratory and biomarker values**
- **Treatment details** (initial therapy, transplant, supportive care, subsequent lines)
- **Longitudinal clinical outcomes**  
  – Response, relapse, PFS, OS  
- **Imaging and bone disease assessments**
- **Pathology and cytogenetic results** (when available)
- **Patient-reported outcomes** (QoL instruments)

## Biospecimen Collection

Participants provided:

- **Bone marrow aspirates**
- **Peripheral blood samples**

at diagnosis and at structured follow-up visits. These specimens were used for:

- Whole genome sequencing (WGS)  
- Whole exome sequencing (WES)  
- RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)  
- Single-cell RNA sequencing (subset of samples)

This paired clinical and genomic dataset enables exploration of molecular drivers, clonal evolution, and clinical outcomes at unprecedented depth.

## Interim Analysis (IA) Releases

CoMMpass data were released incrementally in **24 Interim Analyses (IA01–IA24)**. Each IA represented a defined “data cut” incorporating:

- Newly enrolled patients  
- Updated clinical follow-up  
- Newly sequenced biospecimens  
- Pipeline improvements and QC refinements  

IA24 represents the **final, most complete** data release for both clinical and genomic datasets.

## Access in the MMRF Virtual Lab

The MMRF Virtual Lab provides controlled access to **project-level summary files** for all historic CoMMpass IA releases and comprehensive clinical + genomic files for IA24.

Users can:

- Build cohorts using clinical variables  
- Compare clinical characteristics  
- Analyze survival and clinical distributions  
- Download summary-level files from the Repository  

For details on accessing IA releases, see the *Interim Analysis Data Access* section.
