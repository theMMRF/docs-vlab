# CoMMpass Interim Analysis  

The **CoMMpass study** was designed to collect and release genomic and clinical data in an iterative fashion over the course of the project. This structure ensured that researchers, pharmaceutical partners, and internal MMRF teams had access to high quality data in a timely and reproducible manner. Each **Interim Analysis (IA)** served as a defined “data cut”, incorporating new patients, new follow-up visits, or refinements to analytical pipelines and quality control standards.

Across the lifespan of CoMMpass, 24 interim analyses were planned, culminating in IA24, the final comprehensive release of harmonized clinical and genomic data for all study participants. 

## Data Release Framework
Each Interim Analysis release contained multiple data layers:

| Data Layer | Description | Example Outputs
|-------|--------------| --------------|
| Clinical Data | Updated patient-level variables (diagnosis, treatments, outcomes) | Clinical.tsv, therapy tables |
| Genomic Data | WGS/WES VCFs, RNA-seq expression, CNV, SV, and annotation files | .vcf.gz, .maf, .counts.txt |
| Metadata | Sample identifiers, assay QC metrics, version tracking | Sample manifests, readme logs |
| Documentation | README, change logs, pipeline versions | IA11_README.txt, JetStream logs |

## Accessing the Data

*This section will describe how to access CoMMpass data releases within the MMRF Virtual Lab once repository access instructions are finalized.*
