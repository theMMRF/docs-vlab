# CoMMpass Overview

The **MMRF CoMMpass Study** is a landmark longitudinal genomic and clinical study of more than 1,100 patients with multiple myeloma. Designed to accelerate research and improve patient outcomes, CoMMpass integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data to provide a comprehensive view of the disease across diagnosis, treatment, and relapse.

As one of the largest multiple myeloma datasets in the public domain, CoMMpass has helped researchers uncover critical insights into patient subtypes, risk stratification, treatment response, and potential therapeutic targets. The study also reflects the real-world patient population - with 17% of participants identifying as Black, consistent with the overall demographic profile of myeloma incidence.

Over a decade of data collection and analysis, CoMMpass has become a foundational resource for the global myeloma research community, driving discoveries that continue to shape how the disease is studied and treated.
