# CoMMpass Overview

The **MMRF CoMMpass Study** is a landmark longitudinal genomic and clinical study of more than 1,100 patients with multiple myeloma. Designed to accelerate research and improve patient outcomes, CoMMpass integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data to provide a comprehensive view of the disease across diagnosis, treatment, and relapse. This includes detailed patient demographics and family history; longitudinal clinical outcomes spanning more than eight years of myeloma treatment; sequencing of tumor and germline DNA; tumor gene expression data; and single-cell characterization of the immune system (scRNA-seq and CyTOF), as well as enumeration of circulating tumor cells.

The study was designed and executed through collaboration across multiple biopharmaceutical partners and clinical centers, with the goal of building a comprehensive molecular and clinical profile for each participant and establishing a global data-sharing framework for the myeloma research community to facilitate therapeutic discovery and drug development.

As the largest and most comprehensive multiple myeloma dataset available worldwide, CoMMpass has enabled researchers to uncover critical insights into patient subtypes, risk stratification, treatment response, potential therapeutic targets, and the complex biology of the immune microenvironment. Importantly, the study reflects a real-world patient population, with 17% Black/African American participants—consistent with the demographic distribution of myeloma incidence in the United States.

Through proactive and strategic growth over more than a decade of data collection, CoMMpass has become a foundational resource for the global myeloma research community, driving discoveries that continue to inform strategies for disease subtyping, treatment, and drug development. Recent studies in 2025 and 2026 include the development of IMS/Consensus Genomic Subtypes for high- and low-risk multiple myeloma, as well as Immune Atlas profiling of 1.37 million cells from the bone marrow microenvironment of 337 patients. These and other recent reports highlight the ongoing relevance of this large, well-annotated, and mature dataset.
