# Introduction and Study Overview  

## Background  
The **MMRF CoMMpass Study** is a landmark, longitudinal, multi-center research effort designed to comprehensively map the genomic and clinical landscape of **multiple myeloma (MM)**. Launched in 2011, CoMMpass represents one of the most ambitious precision medicine initiatives in cancer, establishing the largest genomic and clinical dataset ever assembled for a single cancer type.  

The study’s goal is to **understand how a patient’s molecular profile influences disease progression and treatment response**, ultimately enabling more precise, personalized therapies for patients with multiple myeloma.

## Study Purpose  
The primary objectives of the CoMMpass study are to:  

- **Characterize the genomic landscape** of multiple myeloma across newly diagnosed patients.  
- **Correlate genomic features with clinical outcomes**, such as response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.  
- **Enable data-driven patient stratification** to support personalized treatment decisions.  
- **Accelerate drug discovery and clinical development** through integration of genomic and clinical insights.  

Through continuous data generation, integration, and public sharing, CoMMpass has provided the research community with an unprecedented resource for understanding myeloma biology and improving patient outcomes.

## Study Timeline  
- **2011:** Study initiation and first patient enrollment.  
- **2012–2016:** Progressive data generation and interim analyses (IA2–IA10).  
- **2017–2020:** Expansion of genomic assays, longitudinal follow-up, and public data releases through MMRF platforms.  
- **2025:** Final data harmonization and release (IA24) into the MMRF Virtual Lab.

## Major Goals and Impact  

CoMMpass was conceived to:  

- Build a comprehensive **molecular and clinical profile** of each participant.  
- Enable the **identification of molecular subtypes** and high-risk patient groups.  
- Provide **real-world, longitudinal evidence** for biomarker-driven therapies.  
- Create a **global data-sharing framework** for the myeloma research community.  

Insights generated from CoMMpass have directly influenced clinical trial development, including the **MMRC MyDRUG** study, and have informed major translational research initiatives aimed at discovering new therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers.

## Data Accessibility and Legacy  
All harmonized CoMMpass data are available through the **MMRF Virtual Lab**, an integrated data-sharing and analysis environment that provides secure access to genomic, clinical, and molecular datasets. The Virtual Lab ensures the long-term sustainability and accessibility of the CoMMpass dataset, supporting continued research and innovation in multiple myeloma.
