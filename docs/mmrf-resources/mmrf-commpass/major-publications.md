# Impact & Major Publications

Over more than a decade of longitudinal data collection and analysis, the MMRF CoMMpass Study has generated foundational insights that have reshaped the understanding of multiple myeloma biology, risk stratification, immune dynamics, and therapeutic resistance.

CoMMpass-derived discoveries have directly influenced:

- Clinical trial design and patient stratification
- Identification of novel therapeutic targets
- Development of genomic and immune-based risk classifiers
- Translation of molecular findings into precision medicine strategies

Below we highlight selected **case studies** where CoMMpass findings have directly informed clinical or therapeutic approaches, followed by **additional key publications** that collectively define the scientific impact of the study.

## Case Studies

Numerous CoMMpass-derived reports have significantly advanced the understanding of myeloma subtypes, therapeutic targets, immune states, and risk stratification—enabling incorporation into drug development pipelines and clinical trial strategies.

### 1. Defining High-Risk Multiple Myeloma

CoMMpass data enabled the development of an integrated high-risk classification that combines clinical, cytogenetic, and genomic features. This approach improves identification of patients with poor prognosis despite modern triplet or quadruplet therapies and forms the basis for ongoing high-risk–focused clinical trials.

### 2. Disease Transitions and Immune Evolution

Integrated analysis of CoMMpass tumor genomics and single-cell immune profiling revealed immune and tumor state transitions during progression from smoldering myeloma to multiple myeloma, linking immune phenotypes to clinical outcomes across rapid and slow progression subtypes.
